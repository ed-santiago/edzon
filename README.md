## Demo Link

## About the app
EDZON is my phase-1 project with Academy Xi. The main goal of the project is to showcase the concepts I have learnt throughout the phase-1 module.
I wanted to imitate an online store web app because it is a common website that can be built with vanilla JavaScript. It also allows for a lot of user interactivity
which makes a website feel rich with a lot of JavaScript logic. The main features of this web application comes from using full CRUD actions with fetch from my db
json server to allow the user to interact with product items and the shopping cart. It is a single-page application.
Some main JavaScript concepts I've implemented in this project are:
- Conditionals
- Statements
- Functions
- Loops
- Objects and arrays
- Array method and iterator methods
- Event handling
- DOM manipulation
- Asynchronous JavaScript

## Technologies
I used JavaScript, CSS, HTML and VSCode to build and finish the project.

For a Node server, I followed the json-server-template(https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/json-server-template) 
to build a database. Afterwards, I used a free service called Render(https://render.com/) to deploy my Node server. This way, I don't need to
setup and run my server locally every time I need to work on my project.

Finally, once I finished my project I used GitHub pages to host my github repository.

## Setup
To view, explore and experiment with the source code, fork and clone this repository, then open it with your code editor. To view the website on a browser, type
"explorer.exe index.html" for windows. I am not familiar with Mac, so I don't know the command.

**Please note: opening the website for the first time, may take a minute or so for some content to appear.** As I am using the free version of Render.

## Credits
Thank you to Academy Xi for giving the main bulk of resources I need.
